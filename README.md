# Save-em-All
This is second game I made as learning Unity.
Game description: It is a 3D game with top-to-bottom camera view where you play as a car and try to save people from meteor rain. You drive through the city, trying to avoid randomly-spawn metors falling from the sky. You need to drive nice and slow to the person you want to save, otherwise he will be knocked down by you. There is also different cars you can choose to play.
